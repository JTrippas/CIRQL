# CIRQL: Conversational Information Retrieval Query Log

[CIRQL][jt] is created from a crowdsourcing experiment where workers could opt-in to
share the logs of their Google smart assistant devices. The entirety of this
data consists of over 600,000 interactions (either inputs from the users or
responses from the assistant) from 173 unique users. CIRQL is a strict subset
of the *user* interactions generated by a filtering process; the filtering
aimed to remove common commands and non-query interactions (like *turn off
the lights*) as well as any non-English inputs, addresses, phone numbers,
emojis, and so on.

The whole filtering process is described in the paper below.

## Dataset

The resulting dataset, CIRQL, contains 2,807 queries from 1,799 user sessions.
Session data is synthetic and derived using an inactivity period of 15 minutes.
The order of queries within a session is ascending chronological.
Therefore the first query of a session is time step `t1`, the second query is time step `t2`,
and so on.

## Complex Sessions
The key focus of our initial analysis was on complex sessions. The remainder
of this README will outline specific examples of behaviours we observed from
(15 minute) sessions containing CIRQL queries. Due to privacy concerns, we
currently only share the queries and their timestamps. We hope to release
more comprehensive data after a more thorough vetting process.
